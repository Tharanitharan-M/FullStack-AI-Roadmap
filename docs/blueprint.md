ü§ñ How AI Should Be Used

The application should use AI to generate:
	1.	‚úÖ Subtopics within each Learning Pillar
Example: For the pillar ‚ÄúBackend Development,‚Äù AI could suggest:
	‚Ä¢	Express.js routing
	‚Ä¢	Flask APIs
	‚Ä¢	JWT authentication
	‚Ä¢	Role-based access control
	‚Ä¢	Error handling
	2.	üìò Short explanations for each subtopic
These should answer:
‚ÄúWhy am I learning this?‚Äù
Example: ‚ÄúJWT authentication is essential for securing APIs in modern web applications.‚Äù
	3.	üîÑ (Optional) Smart Recommendations
Suggest which pillar to focus on next based on user pace or what‚Äôs trending in tech.
